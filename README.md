# Labs

## Lab2 
Your task is to generate a report using MapReduce (similar to the WordCount
program) showing the total amount of prepaid cards for each customer that they have
purchased. For example, if a customer with ID 300 purchased 5 cards with 10, 15,
15, 10, 100, then the report should include that customer ID 300 bought cards with a
total amount of 150.
